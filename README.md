# Artist Store

### My Requirements

The first thing I had to do before starting Artist Store was research. My four goals were to **identify my primary audience**, **research the problem** the audience is having, **propose a solution to the problem**, and identify **how I can address the problem** better than my competition.

I determined that my audience were 16-30 year old musical artists. A problem they had was not knowing how to sell merchandise online or not being able to do it easily. There were other websites that offered the ability to sell merchandise, but they tended to be confusing or cost a lot. My solution was to make a store that artists can sign up for and sell merchandise in a CRUD based approach. I wanted my app to be easy to use, so I made a clean interface and kept the selling and buying sides nearly identical. I built the application using React.js, Node.js, & and GraphQL. Features include search, add to cart, checkout, orders, order details, sales & traffic charts, image uploading, and form submission. To start off and beat my competition, the tool is free to use and easy to use.
